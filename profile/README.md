<h1>1 - Project Overview</h1>
This work aims to create a web-based application that can run machine learning tasks, generate graphical insights from the trained models, and do predictions.

<h1>2 - Application Architecture</h1>
The app consists of 3 main layers: frontend, backend, and database.

<h2>2.1 - Frontend</h2>
The frontend contains browser side code such as HTML, JS, CSS. The application frontend is developed using Angular framework with npm as dependency manager.

<h2>2.2 - Backend</h2>
The backend is written in Python and is being served using Flask as an API webservice. It receives API calls that the frontend sends out and runs backend processes such as ML model training or querying the database.
